I want to solve the challenges of digitalization in a way that focuses on citizens and especially on their privacy.


For this purpose, I specialized in anonymous authentication methods during my PhD. 
These enable the operation of robust services, while taking into account the protection of citizens.
By focusing on anonymity, one of the things I hope to achieve is broader adoption of those infrastructures.

<!--1 anon RKE: protecting eids even against corrution>-->
In our most recent work, we invented the first end-to-end encryption protocol that guarantees strongest anonymity guarantees, even in the case of corruption of individual users. We can guarantee that confidentiality, authenticity and anonymity are restored even in the event that an attacker temporarily takes control of the end user device. 


<!--2AC online access literally in german ?>-->
During our work on blind signatures, we have been working on basic building blocks to enable access to online resources in a strongly authenticated and anonymous manner. This means that infrastructure operators have strong guarantees that the service cannot be abused and citizens have the guarantee that as little data as possible is generated.
